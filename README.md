# tabulerl

Let's have a TDS driver for Erlang! Using the [Elixir TDS driver](https://github.com/livehelpnow/tds/issues) as a reference.

This is a work-in-progress, obviously, and isn't at all working yet.

## Build
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/sourgrasses/tabulerl.git
$ cd tabulerl/
$ rebar3 compile
```
